# Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Courses
Courses from the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)

Most of the assignments (apart from the capstone) involved using AWS SageMaker to define and train machine learning models and using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for deployment.
